        a) to inform the bidder of the win and
        b) to convey certain information using substitution macros.

    The “adomain” attribute can be used to check advertiser block list compliance.
    The “iurl” attribute can provide a link to an image that is representative of the campaign’s
    content (irrespective of whether the campaign may have multiple creatives).
    This enables human review for spotting inappropriate content.
    The “cid” attribute can be used to block ads that were previously identified as inappropriate;
    essentially a safety net beyond the block lists.
    The “crid” attribute can be helpful in reporting creative issues back to bidders.
    Finally, the “attr” array indicates the creative attributes that describe the ad to be served.
